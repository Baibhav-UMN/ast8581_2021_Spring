    "Since period finding is one of the main time series analysis techniques in astronomy, we're going to explore some of the dependencies of the most popular period finding algorithm -- the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (see Jake Vanderplas' excellent review article on this: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09824 and with associated code at https://github.com/jakevdp/PracticalLombScargle/). In particular, we want to assess its performance as a function of signal-to-noise, time series sampling, and waveform shape. It is often worth investigating the performance of algorithms in terms of toy data sets to get an understanding of what the limitations may be. So:"
